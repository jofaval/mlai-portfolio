# M.L. && A.I. - Portfolio #
Portfolio of all my Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence projects and "background".
It may be mixed with Data Science/Analysis of the given results. Or maybe even full projects.

## Website
Using a bit of background as a Web Developer I created my website from scratch and serve it as static files so it renders as fast as possible.

#### Why MLAI?
It comes from **M**achine **L**earning and **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence. It's a nice acronym and it wouldn't be mistaken so easily with other variations, since `aiml` for example, is already used in computing science for `AIML` (**A**rtificial **I**ntelligence **M**ark-up **L**anguage)

## Experience

All my experience

### Background
I come from a Software and Web Development background (Computer Science related). But I started in the world of IT with graphic design, and by chance I was introduced to computing. One thing led to another and here we are =).

### Motivation
Everyone's talking about A.I., Machine Learning and Big Data these days, all around the news, computer science is taking a new big step, why not gaze into it?!

### Projects
None... atm.
